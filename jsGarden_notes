1. The 'for in' loop is the 'long way home' when creating for loops for iterating through arrays
2.Its always best and most efficient to use a basic for loop for arrays
3.When creating the length property on a variable within a string inside a 'for' loop, there is no way of knowing what engine will be used to optimize and cache each iterization... no way of knowing how fast the cacheing process will take.
4.Best to always us literals when creating an array '[]'
5. When creating an array with only one iteration and when that iteration is a number, only the length property will cache this information.
6.using '==' is defined as 'weak-typing' because it coerces the result to be a true statement.
7.Using '==' is considered bad practice in JS and leads to errors in code.
8.using '===' is 'strict' and therefore a precise operand that does not coerce its value
9.When using '===' errors appear earlier in code and are less likely to have deeply nested errors.
10.The only time a coder should consider using the '==' operator is when they explicitly understand all of the JS coersion rules that will apply.
11.Author considers 'typeof' to be a design flaw of the JS language because it does not strictly/reliably define the 'type-of' Class of an object.
12.'typeof' is only useful to find out if a variable has been declared.
13. It is best to use Object.prototype.toString to find the 'type-of' an object.
14.Avoid using 'instanceof' operator unless on a custom made object.
15. There are better ways to find the 'type of' or 'instance of' and object than there namesakes.
16.Because JS is considered a weakly typed language, it will attempt to coerce values into truthiness.... so, always use strict operators and force JS to behave.
17.When using the not operator '!' twice '!!' a value will be converted to a boolean (unless there is no value)
18.When casting a value (+10) to an empty string you can create a stricter form of coersion while using the '===' operator.
19. '10'=== 10 is false; however, when using the '+' operator +'10' === 10 is true.
